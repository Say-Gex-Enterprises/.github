Say Gex Laboratory
About Us

The Say Gex Laboratory was conceived by twins Danil Ivanov (skd) and Brad Pit.  Ironically, the Say Gex Enterprise specializes in eugenics and genetic enhancement.

This laboratory is a subsidiary of the megacorporation "Say Gex Holding," which owns 100% of the company and is responsible for all staff, personnel, and research projects.


After their "release" from a maximum security prison on June 23rd, They worked hard to establish the first research facility under the Say Gex Holding HQ, right in their basement.

Say Gex Laboratory also plays a prominent role in the field of the pharmaceutical industry. Just one year after we founded our organization, We released the first and most efficient vaccine for diabetes (However, it's only obtainable through illegitmate means for now due to the blatant racism of the FDA)
