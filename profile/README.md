Say Gex Laboratory
About Us

The Say Gex Laboratory is the brainchild of conjoined twins Danil Ivanov (skd) and Brad Pit—a duo as unconventional as their vision. Ironically, the laboratory specializes in eugenics and genetic enhancement, fields that demand precision, innovation, and a touch of audacity.

Founded under the umbrella of the megacorporation Say Gex Holdings, the laboratory is a wholly owned subsidiary. Say Gex Holdings oversees all operations, personnel, and research projects, ensuring that the twins' ambitious ideas are executed with corporate efficiency.

The story of Say Gex Laboratory begins on June 27th, the day Danil and Brad were "released" from a maximum-security prison. With nothing but their shared intellect and a basement beneath the Say Gex Holdings headquarters, they established their first research facility. From these humble beginnings, the laboratory has grown into a prominent player in the pharmaceutical and genetic engineering industries.

Just one year after its founding, Say Gex Laboratory made headlines with the release of the world’s first and most efficient diabetes vaccine. However, due to what the twins describe as "blatant FDA racism," the vaccine is currently only available through alternative distribution channels. (We’re working on it.)
